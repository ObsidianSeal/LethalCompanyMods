# HotbarPlus
## Fully Customizable!

- The number of hotbar slots is fully customizable in the config. You can set more than the default 4 slots, or even less if you want!<br>
**The above setting is host-only, and will not be used if the host does not have this mod.**
- The spacing between the hotbar HUD elements is adjustable.
- The scale of the hotbar HUD elements can be adjusted. Position and spacing will automatically scale, as well.
- The hotbar HUD fade alpha can be adjusted. Default: 0.13 | Set to 0 for full fade | Set to 1 for no fade.

### Supports InputUtils

- Any relevant hotkeys for this mod can be managed in the in-game keybind menu.
- InputUtils is not a dependency, but is recommended!

## Quality of Life

- Fixes inventory UI positioning. This recenters the default inventory UI because it's off-center for some reason, and shifts other inventory UI elements.
- Inverts the scrolling direction on your hotbar to be like most other games. This can be disabled in the config.
The base game now has this setting, but it also inverts the terminal scrolling direction, so this setting still may be of use.
- Removes the delay between swapping hotbar slots! You will be able to swap slots much faster!
- Also removes other forced delays between various events, such as discarding, interacting, activating items, etc.
- This mod adds numeric hotkeys for your hotbar slots. This can be disabled in the config.
- The emote keys have been rebound to F1 and F2. These can be disabled, or edited in the config.<br>
This setting is mainly to prevent overlap between the default emote hotkeys, and the numeric hotkeys for swapping inventory slots.
- Added the option for quick dropping in the config (enabled by default). You can now chain drop items. After dropping an item, you will automatically switch to another item on your hotbar. As of 1.8.2, scrap items will have a higher priority, and then non-weapon scrap will have a higher priority, and then heavier items will slightly affect priority.
- Added a lightning warning indicator over item slots when a held metal object is about to be struck by lightning. The indicator currently ignores the item slot alpha, which means it will always be fully visible when active.<br>
This feature can be disabled in the config.

## Purchasing Additional Hotbar Slots

- The host can specify how many additional hotbar slots can be purchased in the config.
- The purchase price can be adjustable, as well as the price increase for each additional item slot.<br>
Example: *First slot: 200 credits, Second: 300 credits, Third: 400 credits, etc.*
- To purchase an additional hotbar slot, you will need to type "Hotbar" or "HotbarPlus" in the terminal for instructions.
- Purchased slots will be saved to the current game save in which they were bought, and will be reset upon restarting the game.
- Additional slots *cannot* be purchased *unless* the host has the mod.
- This has been tested with my ReservedItemSlot mods, and *seems* to play nicely if slots are purchased mid game.<br>
*I cannot guarantee the same for other mods that may add more inventory slots.*
- This feature may have bugs, so it would be greatly appreciated if you could report any bugs on the github page :) Thank you!

## All Clients are Synced!

- All clients will have their hotbar size synced with the host, regardless of their config. Equality! If the host does not have this mod, this setting will not be used.
- Clients will have their currently selected hotbar slot synced with each other, even when swapping slots with the numerical hotkeys.
- Swapping hotbar slots will sync perfectly with any set hotbar size. Clients without this mod are not guaranteed to sync their currently held item all the time.
<br><br>

## Compatibility

- Should play nicely with *most* mods.
- Compatible with the ReservedItemSlot mods!
